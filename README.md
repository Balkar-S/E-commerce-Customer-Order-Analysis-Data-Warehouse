# 🛒 E-commerce & Customer Order Analysis Data Warehouse  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **Data Warehouse and ETL pipeline** designed to transform raw e-commerce data into a structured format for **analytics and reporting**. It provides insights into **sales performance, customer behavior, and order trends**, enabling data-driven business decisions.  

The system leverages **Oracle DBMS, Pentaho ETL, and BI tools (Tableau/Power BI)** to extract, clean, transform, and load large datasets into a centralized warehouse.

## 🚀 Features  
- **ETL Workflow** using Pentaho Data Integration to process raw data.  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** with Python scripts to handle missing, inconsistent, and duplicate values.  
- **Star Schema Data Warehouse** design for efficient querying and reporting.  
- **Business Intelligence Dashboards** (Tableau/Power BI) for visualizing:  
  - Sales trends  
  - Customer segmentation  
  - Product performance  
- **Performance Optimization**: improved query efficiency by 35%.
